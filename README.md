# pcos_prediction-
created a pcos prediction model using support vector machine algorithm with accuracy of 98 % 

#challenges 
.>>>at very first i had idea to use logistic regression on it and i used it but dues to small data of 3000 row the model
 tends to overfit even after tunning hyperparameter its been same
>>>then i changed algorithm and used randomforest as far i knew the expected overfitting but my thought was to control that with 
 hyperparameter tunning but in the end result was the same after tunning it was still overfitting 
>>> after that i remember that knn and svm are supposed to work on small datasets i used them both both didnt overfit but knn's
  confusion maetrics was not good then i switch to svm as it showed good result with accuracy 99% and cm [[718   2]
 [  0 180]]
>>> deploying gave me huge trouble for scaler and pickle i had it enough then i took assistance of friend with deployment
>>>would like to try deploying it again without any support



let me know what should i correct am always eager to learn more
